## Description: 

The incentiBox Social Media Sharing Rewards module transforms ordinary customers into word-of-mouth brand advocates!

Incentivize customers to share your products on their social networks (Facebook wall posts, Tweets, blog posts, etc.) and to "like" your Facebook page. In return, your customers are rewarded with store credit, redeemable only at your store.

Incentivized sharing is a great way to generate sales and increase brand awareness for your CRE Loaded store!

Coupon codes are auto-generated, and show up in the admin > coupons panel. Coupon codes and rewards program emails are completely customizable, as is the look and feel of the widget. The widget is collapsible, and can hover on the side of your store, to remind users of your rewards program. 

Example: Give users $5 off any order, for spreading the word about your products with their social network. You gain word-of-mouth advertising, AND generate a sale when the user redeems their store credit!

Notes: This module has been tested with CREloaded. This plugin interfaces with incentiBox, and communicates through the incentiBox API. For more information, and to sign up for incentiBox for API access, please see <a href='http://www.incentibox.com/?ref=github2'>www.incentiBox.com</a>.
