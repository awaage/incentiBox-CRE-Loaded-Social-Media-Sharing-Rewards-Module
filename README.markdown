## Description: 

The social media login & sharing rewards module is a plugin enables users to sign in to your CREloaded store via Facebook account, and incentivizes your customers and site-visitors to "like" your Facebook page, and share your products with their friends via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and 300+ others). In return, your customers will receive store credit, redeemable only at your store!

Coupon codes are auto-generated, and show up in the admin > coupons panel. Coupon codes and rewards program emails are completely customizable, as is the look and feel of the widget. The widget is collapsible, and can hover on the side of your store, to remind users of your rewards program. 

Example: Give users $5 off any order, for spreading the word about your products with their social network. You gain word-of-mouth advertising, AND generate a sale when the user redeems their store credit!

Notes: This extension has been tested with CREloaded. This plugin interfaces with incentiBox, and communicates through the incentiBox API. For more information, and to sign up for incentiBox for API access, please see <a href='http://www.incentibox.com/?ref=github2'>incentiBox.com</a>.
